Hello, I'm Derek Keith aka [codeurge](https://codeurge.com)! I'm a passionate, self-taught engineer with over 17 years of experience building things for the web. Currently I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [DemandStar](https://demandstar.com). I contribute to open source issues often when I find similar issues, have a workaround, or a solution by PR. I work primarily with JavaScript / TypeScript, and Ruby (not as much lately).

I (kind of) maintain [circle-cli](https://github.com/circle-cli/circle-cli). If you're interested in picking this project up, send me an [email](mailto:derek@codeurge.com). I haven't maintained this rubygem much due to lack of using Ruby and CircleCI in my current workflow.

By night when I'm not codeurge, I'm a Producer/DJ known as [UrgeTo](https://urge.to) - my music is on most streaming platforms including [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3poCrXZxqq5WwKTTdQKcj9), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/urgetomusic), Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music.
